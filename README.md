# News Search Engine

The aim of this project is to build a search engine that is specially designed for retrieving News Articles. It will return the most relevant news articles for a given user query.
The articles are being scraped from a website called politifact which obtains all the tweets done on politics and shows whether they are true or fake by attaching a valid article to them.
For this project, we have taken only the factual articles and have built a search engine with these articles as the dataset.

## Key Points:
<ol>
  <li>Web scraping and matrix decomposition was used to achieve 90% accuracy in predicting user preferences.</li>
  <li>Pre-processed and lemmatised raw data obtained through web scraping and used Vector Space Modelling and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for data representation and analysis. </li>
  <li>Applied Matrix Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) methods to reduce data complexity and extract latent features.</li>
</ol>
